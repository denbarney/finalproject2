Project: Sharing the Harlem Experience
I want to create a dynamic business directory focusing on the 10031 zip code (surrounding The City College of New York).
Using the following tabs, I will pull information from Google maps to provide content:

*Arts & Culture

*Lodging

*Restaurants

*Drug Stores

*Parks and Recreation

*Places of Worship

*Financial Institutions

*Health

*Beauty

*Government & Community Organizations

I have to style my information "card".
